# chimeric-tools

Chimeric-Tools provides a set of tools to help influenza like illness forecast modeling. 

The main purpose of this package is to provide a score for ensemble models of influenza like illnesses. When comparing different ensemble models between different scientific papers there are vast differences in data and base modelâ€™s used to train the ensemble models, thus creating incomparable results.

Current Working Features:
- COVID-19 data for cases, deaths, and hosps
- Simulation of COVID-19 data

Features Coming Soon:
- Baseline forecast models

## Installation

For right now we suggest installing from GitHub because of the rapid development of this project

### pip

Releases are available PyPI and can be installed with `pip`.


```shell
pip install chimeric-tools
```

You can alternatively install the latest version from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/computationalUncertaintyLab/chimeric-tools.git
```


## Documentation

## Examples

### Covid Data

```python
from chimeric_tools.Data import CovidData
data = CovidData(start_date = "2021-01-01", end_date = "2021-12-31", geo_values = "US", include = ["cases", "deaths", "hosps"]).data
data.head()
```

### Covid Simulation

```python
from chimeric_tools.Simulation import COVID
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
bs = COVID(start_date = "2021-01-01", end_date = "2021-12-31", geo_values = "US", include = ["cases"])
for data in bs.simulate(100):
    plt.plot(data[0]["cases"], color= "tab:blue", alpha = 0.1)
plt.xlabel("Weeks")
plt.ylabel("Cases")
plt.title("Covid Simulation of FIP: " + data[1])
plt.show()
```



## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. There are opportunities at many levels to contribute:

- Implement new process, e.g., different bootstrap method
- Improve docstrings where unclear or with typos
- Provide examples, preferably in the form of IPython notebooks
